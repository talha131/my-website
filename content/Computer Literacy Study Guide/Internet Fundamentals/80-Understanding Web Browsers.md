## What is a Web Browser?

A web browser is a free software program on your computer, phone, or tablet. It is the tool you use to visit and see websites on the internet.

## Main Functions of a Web Browser

A browser has many helpful tools to make using the internet easy and safe.

### 1. Navigation: Moving Around the Web

The browser helps you go to different websites. You can use the **address bar** at the top to type in a website's name. The **back** and **forward** buttons let you move between pages you have already seen.

### 2. Tabbed Browsing: Opening Many Pages

This feature lets you open many websites at the same time in a single window. Each website is in its own **tab**, and you can switch between them easily.

### 3. Bookmarking: Saving Your Favorite Pages

A bookmark saves a website's address. This lets you go back to your favorite pages quickly without having to type the address again. It is just like putting a bookmark in a book.

### 4. History: Remembering Where You Have Been

The browser keeps a list of all the websites you have visited. This is helpful if you want to find a page you saw before but forgot its name.

### 5. Private Windows: Browsing in Secret

This opens a special window that does not save your history or information. It is often called **Private Browsing** or **Incognito Mode**, and it is useful for protecting your privacy.

### 6. Security: Keeping You Safe

A browser helps keep you safe from dangerous websites. It will show a **padlock icon** in the address bar to let you know that your connection to a website is private and secure.

### 7. Downloads: Saving Files

The browser has a special place to manage files you get from the internet. When you download a picture or a document, it is saved in the **Downloads** section.

### 8. Extensions: Adding New Features

Extensions are small extra tools that can be added to the browser. These can do things like block ads, check spelling, or help save passwords.

### 9. Syncing: Connecting Your Devices

By creating a free account, the browser can share information like bookmarks and history across all devices. This means the bookmarks saved on a computer will also be on the phone.
