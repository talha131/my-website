## What is a Search Engine?

A search engine is a special website that helps people find things on the internet. It is like a helpful **librarian for the entire web**.

A search engine does three main jobs to give you answers.

### 1. It Gathers Information

A search engine sends out robot programs, called **crawlers**, to discover all the pages on the internet. It then organizes and saves all of this information in a giant digital library, called an **index**.

### 2. It Finds and Ranks the Best Pages

When you type something into the search box, the search engine looks through its index to find every page that matches. It then **ranks** them, putting the most helpful and trusted pages at the top of the list.

### 3. It Shows You the Results

The search engine displays the ranked pages as a simple list for you to use. Each result usually shows a **title**, a **link**, and a **short description** of the page so you can decide which one to click.

### 4. It Helps You By Giving Suggestions

The search engine guesses what you want to find. As you type in the search box, it shows a list of ideas to help you finish. For example, if you type "best teaching...", it might suggest "best teaching strategies."

### 5. It Lets You Filter Your Results

You can make your search more specific using filters. These are special buttons that help you narrow down the results. For example, you can choose to see only **images**, **videos**, or **news** articles.
