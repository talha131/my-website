A computer network connects devices so they can share information. We can group networks into four main types based on their size. These types are:

1. PAN
2. LAN
3. MAN
4. WAN

## PAN (Personal Area Network)

A PAN is a tiny network for one person's devices. It connects things that are very close to each other, like on your desk or in your pocket.

### Examples of PAN

- Connecting a **smartphone** to **Bluetooth headphones**.
- Using a **wireless mouse** with a computer.
- Syncing a **smartwatch** with a phone.
- Connecting a phone to a **car's stereo**.
- Sending a file from a laptop to a phone using a **USB cable**.

### More About PAN

- **How big is it?** It covers a very small area, just a few feet.
- **How fast is it?** It has good speed for personal devices and costs very little.
- **How is it used?** It connects your personal gadgets together.

## LAN (Local Area Network)

A LAN is a network that covers a small, local area. It connects devices in a single building or a small group of buildings.

**_A LAN connects devices in one place, like a home or school._**

### Examples of LAN

- The **Wi-Fi network** in a home.
- All the computers in a **school's computer lab**.
- The printers and computers connected in a **small office**.
- The public Wi-Fi at a **coffee shop**.
- The network at a **local library**.

### More About LAN

- **How big is it?** It covers a single building or a small campus.
- **How fast is it?** It is very fast and does not cost much to set up.
- **How is it used?** It is used to share files, printers, and the internet in one location.

## MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

A MAN is a network that is bigger than a LAN. It can connect computers across a whole city or a very large university campus.

**_A MAN is a network for a whole city._**
{{< /callout >}}

### Examples of MAN

- A **cable TV network** that serves an entire city.
- A university's network that connects **different campuses** in a city.
- A network connecting all **government buildings** downtown.
- A chain of **local hospital branches** that share information.
- A city-wide **public Wi-Fi** network.

### More About MAN

- **How big is it?** It is larger than a LAN and can cover an entire city.
- **How fast is it?** It is faster than a WAN but slower than a LAN.
- **How is it used?** It connects different LANs together across a city.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

A WAN is the largest type of computer network. It connects devices over very large areas, like a country or even the entire world.

{{< callout type="important" icon="bell">}}
**_A WAN connects networks across the globe. The Internet is a WAN._**
{{< /callout >}}

### Examples of WAN

- **The Internet** is the biggest WAN in the world.
- A **bank's network** that connects all its branches in a country.
- A **company's network** that connects its offices in different countries.
- A **military's network** that connects bases around the world.
- An **online gaming network** for players in different countries.

### More About WAN

- **How big is it?** It can cover a country or the whole world.
- **How fast is it?** It is usually slower than a LAN and costs a lot to manage.
- **How is it used?** It is used to connect different LANs over long distances.
