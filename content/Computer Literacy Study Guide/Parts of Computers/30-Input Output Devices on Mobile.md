A mobile phone has many parts that help it interact with the user and the world. Some parts are for putting information **in** (input), and some are for getting information **out** (output).

**Input** devices send information _to_ the phone. **Output** devices send information _from_ the phone.

## 5 Common Input Devices on a Smartphone

Input devices are used to give the phone commands or information.

- **Touch Screen**
  The screen is an input device because it detects a finger's touch. It allows a person to type, swipe, and tap to control the phone.

- **Microphone**
  The microphone captures sound. It is used during phone calls or when recording a voice message.

- **Camera**
  The camera is an input device that captures light to take photos and videos.

- **Sensors**
  Sensors are tiny parts that measure things like motion and light. For example, a sensor can tell the phone to rotate the screen when it is turned sideways.

- **Fingerprint Sensor**
  This small sensor scans a fingerprint. It is used to securely unlock the phone or approve payments.

## 5 Common Output Devices on a Smartphone

Output devices are used by the phone to share information with the user.

- **Touch Screen**
  The screen is also an output device because it displays information. It shows text, images, videos, and everything else needed to use the phone.

- **Speaker**
  The speaker produces sound. It is used to hear music, the other person on a phone call, or video audio.

- **Flashlight (LED Light)**
  The flashlight is an output device because the phone's software can control it to give a signal. For example, it can be set to **blink** when a call or a message comes in.

- **Vibration Motor**
  This is a tiny motor inside the phone that shakes. It creates vibrations for notifications, which is an output that can be felt.

- **Notification LED**
  Some phones have a small light that blinks to give information. This is an output device that can show if there is a new message or if the battery is low, without turning on the whole screen.

The **touch screen** is special because it is both an input and an output device. It can **take in** commands from a touch and **give out** visual information at the same time.
