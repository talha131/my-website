## 1. Use Strong Passwords

A strong password is long and hard for others to guess. It should mix letters, numbers, and symbols. A good password should not be a simple word like a name or a city.

## 2. Use a Password Manager

Password managers are safe apps that create and store very strong passwords. This means a person only has to remember one main password for the manager itself.

## 3. Turn On Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA adds a second step to logging in, like a code sent to a phone. This means that even if a criminal steals a password, they still cannot get into the account.

## 4. Install and Update Antivirus Software

Antivirus software is a program that finds and removes viruses from a computer. It is very important to keep it running and updated to protect against new threats.

## 5. Keep All Software Updated

Regularly updating the operating system (like Windows), web browser, and other apps is very important. Updates often include fixes for security holes that criminals could use to attack a device.

## 6. Beware of Urgent or Emotional Messages

Scammers often send fake messages that try to make a person feel scared or excited. They might say an account is locked or that a big prize has been won. These are tricks to make a person click without thinking.

## 7. Be Careful with Phishing Messages

Phishing is a trick where someone sends a fake email or message to steal information. These messages often look real and might ask for a password or bank details. Never click on links in messages from unknown people.

## 8. Check the Website Address Before Clicking

Scammers create fake website addresses that look very similar to real ones. Always check the main part of the link, which is the name that comes right before the `.com` or `.gov.pk`. An official link will always have the real company or government name in that spot.

## 9. Use Secure Websites (HTTPS)

Before entering any personal information on a website, check the address bar. A safe website will show a **padlock icon** and start with **`https://`**. This means the connection is private and secure.

## 10. Do Not Share Too Much Personal Information

Be careful about sharing personal details online, like a home address, phone number, or CNIC number. Criminals can use this information for identity theft.

## 11. Download from Trusted Websites Only

Only download software, apps, and files from official and trusted websites. Downloading from unknown sites can lead to installing viruses and other harmful software.

## 12. Use a Firewall

A firewall is like a digital wall for a computer. It watches the internet traffic coming to and from the device and blocks anything that looks dangerous. Most operating systems have a built-in firewall that should be kept on.

## 13. Backup Your Data Regularly

It is very important to save a copy of your important files. You can back them up to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. If your computer breaks or gets a virus, you will not lose your work.

## 14. Scan Flash Drives and Memory Cards

Flash drives (USBs) and memory cards can carry viruses from one computer to another. Always scan them with antivirus software before opening any files.

## 15. Mark Spam and Junk Mail

When a suspicious email is received, mark it as **spam** or **junk**. This teaches the email service to block similar dangerous messages in the future.

## 16. Be Careful on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi, like at a coffee shop or airport, is not very secure. Avoid doing important things like online banking or shopping when connected to it.

## 17. Think Before Clicking

The most important rule is to be careful. If an offer looks too good to be true, it is probably a scam. If a link or an attachment looks strange, do not click on it.

## 18. Learn About Online Dangers

Learning about new online dangers is an important way to stay safe. From time to time, reading simple guides or news helps people understand new tricks that criminals use and how to avoid them.
