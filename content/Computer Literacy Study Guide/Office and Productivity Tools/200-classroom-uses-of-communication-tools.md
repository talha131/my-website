## 1. Class Communication through Groups

Teachers create class groups on apps like WhatsApp or Discord. This is used for important announcements like school timings, holidays, or exam dates.

## 2. Sharing Notes and Study Materials

Teachers share notes, worksheets, and pictures of the blackboard in the class group. This ensures all students have the study materials they need, even if they are at home.

## 3. Announcing Test Results

After an exam, teachers can share student marks or result sheets directly in the class group. This is a fast way to inform both students and parents.

## 4. Conducting Live Online Classes

Apps like Zoom and Google Meet are used to conduct live online classes. Students can see and hear the teacher in real-time, just like in a regular classroom.

## 5. Recording Lessons for Revision

Teachers can record their live online classes. Absent students can watch the recording later to catch up, and others can re-watch it to revise a topic.

## 6. Submitting Homework

Students can take a picture of their completed homework and send it to the teacher through a private message on these apps. This is an easy way to submit and check assignments.

## 7. Teaching Through Voice Notes and Videos

Some teachers teach entire lessons using communication apps. They send short voice notes or video clips to explain a topic step-by-step.

## 8. Quick Question and Answer Sessions

If a student has a question while studying at home, they can ask it in the class group or channel. The teacher or another student can answer, which helps clear up confusion quickly.

## 9. Screen Sharing for Demonstrations

During a live class, a teacher can share their screen. This is very useful for teaching computer skills or showing a diagram or a map in detail.

## 10. Student Collaboration on Projects

Students can create their own groups on apps like WhatsApp or Discord to work together on a project. They can share ideas, divide up the work, and discuss the project without having to meet in person.

## 11. Virtual Parent-Teacher Meetings

Schools can arrange parent-teacher meetings over Zoom or Google Meet. This saves parents the time and effort of traveling to the school.

## 12. Conducting Oral Exams (Viva)

Teachers can use a video call on an app like Zoom or WhatsApp to conduct a one-on-one oral exam. This is a common practice for practical subjects and final year projects.

## 13. Inviting Guest Speakers

A school can invite an expert from another city or country to give a lecture to students using a live video call. This allows students to learn from different people without any travel.
