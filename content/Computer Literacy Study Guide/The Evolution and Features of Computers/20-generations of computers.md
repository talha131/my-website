The history of computers is split into five stages, called generations. Each generation is based on a big change in technology that made computers better, smaller, and faster.

- **First Generation**: Used Vacuum Tubes
- **Second Generation**: Used Transistors
- **Third Generation**: Used Integrated Circuits
- **Fourth Generation**: Used Microprocessors
- **Fifth Generation**: Uses Artificial Intelligence

## First Generation: Vacuum Tubes

First-generation computers were the earliest computers ever made. They used large glass tubes called vacuum tubes to run.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Key Component**: **_Vacuum Tubes_**
{{< /callout >}}

### Advantages

- It was the first technology to perform calculations automatically.
- They were the fastest calculating devices of their time.
- They were a huge step forward in technology.

### Disadvantages

- They were huge and often filled an entire room.
- They used a lot of electricity and created too much heat.
- They often broke down and were not reliable.

### Examples of Computers

- ENIAC
- UNIVAC

### Key Achievements

- **_Input_**: Used paper punch cards to get information.
- **_Programming_**: Programmed using machine language (1s and 0s).

## Second Generation: Transistors

In the second generation, small devices called transistors replaced the big vacuum tubes. This made computers much better.

{{< callout>}}
**Key Component**: **_Transistors_**
{{< /callout >}}

### Advantages

- Computers became much smaller than before.
- They used less power and created less heat.
- They were faster and more reliable.

### Disadvantages

- They were still very expensive to own.
- They still produced enough heat to need cooling systems.
- A person needed special training to use them.

### Examples of Computers

- IBM 1401
- UNIVAC 1108

### Key Achievements

- **_Programming_**: First high-level programming languages were made, like **COBOL** and **FORTRAN**.
- **_Storage_**: Used magnetic tapes to store information.

---

## Third Generation: Integrated Circuits

Third-generation computers used Integrated Circuits, also called ICs. An IC is a tiny chip that holds many transistors.

{{< callout type="important" >}}
**Key Component**: **_Integrated Circuits (ICs)_**
{{< /callout >}}

### Advantages

- Computers became smaller, cheaper, and faster.
- They could run more than one program at a time.
- They used even less electricity.

### Disadvantages

- The IC chips were very difficult to make.
- They still needed cooling to work well.
- The technology was very complex for its time.

### Examples of Computers

- IBM System/360
- PDP-8

### Key Achievements

- **_Input/Output_**: First use of keyboards and monitors.
- **_Operating Systems_**: The first operating systems were created to manage the computer.

---

## Fourth Generation: Microprocessors

Fourth-generation computers are powered by microprocessors. A microprocessor fits the entire computer's brain (CPU) onto a single tiny chip.

{{< callout type="warning" icon="sparkles" >}}
**Key Component**: **_Microprocessors_**
{{< /callout >}}

### Advantages

- Computers became small enough to fit on a desk (Personal Computers).
- They became very powerful and fast.
- They were affordable for regular people to buy.

### Disadvantages

- Making microprocessors is a very difficult process.
- The start of the internet led to new problems like computer viruses.
- People had to learn how to use new and complex software.

### Examples of Computers

- Apple II
- IBM PC
- Modern Laptops

### Key Achievements

- **_Inventions_**: The **mouse** and **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** were created, which made computers easy to use with icons and windows.
- **_Connectivity_**: The internet was developed, allowing computers to connect.

## Fifth Generation: Artificial Intelligence

The fifth generation is what we use today and are building for the future. These computers focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI).

{{< callout type="error" icon="bell" >}}
**Key Component**: **_Artificial Intelligence (AI)_**
{{< /callout >}}

### Advantages

- Computers can understand human language and speech.
- They are able to learn and make decisions.
- They are extremely fast and powerful.

### Disadvantages

- AI technology is very complex and expensive to create.
- It raises questions about safety and what is right or wrong.
- They depend on collecting huge amounts of data.

### Examples of Computers

- Smartphones
- Voice Assistants (like Google Assistant)
- Robots

### Key Achievements

- **_Thinking_**: Focus on AI, machine learning, and neural networks.
- **_Input/Output_**: Use of touch screens, voice commands, and face recognition.
