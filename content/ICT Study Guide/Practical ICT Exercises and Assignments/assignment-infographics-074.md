This assignment involves designing a visually engaging infographic to explain **solar and lunar eclipses**, their formation, and key differences. The infographic should use diagrams, charts, and labels to simplify these celestial phenomena.


## Objective  

Create an infographic that helps viewers understand:  
1. **What are solar and lunar eclipses?**  
2. **How are they formed?**  
3. **Key comparisons between the two phenomena.**  

## Assignment Details  

### Title  

Understanding Solar and Lunar Eclipses

### Instructions  

1. **Research**  
   Collect essential information about solar and lunar eclipses. Focus on:  
   - Definitions and basic concepts.  
   - The difference between solar and lunar eclipses.  
   - How eclipses form (alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth).  

   **Keywords for Research:**  
   - Solar eclipse explanation.  
   - Lunar eclipse process.  
   - Differences between solar and lunar eclipses.  

2. **Infographic Structure**  
   Divide your infographic into these sections:  
   - **Introduction**: Briefly define eclipses and their significance.  
   - **Solar Eclipse**:  
     - Define a solar eclipse.  
     - Use a diagram showing the Sun, Moon, and Earth alignment.  
     - Explain the occurrence of solar eclipses, such as total, partial, and annular eclipses.  
   - **Lunar Eclipse**:   
     - Define a lunar eclipse.  
     - Create a diagram showing the Earth, Moon, and Sun alignment.  
     - Explain how Earth's shadow blocks sunlight to the Moon (umbra and penumbra).  
   - **Comparison Section**:  
     - Use a chart or table to compare solar and lunar eclipses (e.g., occurrence during the day vs. night, visibility area, frequency).  

3. **Design Tips**  
   - Include **bright and bold visuals** to highlight celestial bodies.  
   - Label diagrams clearly to identify shadows (umbra and penumbra) and alignments.  
   - Use **arrows** to show the direction of light and shadow.  
   - Keep the layout clean and easy to follow.  

4. **Essential Components**  
   - Short, clear text describing solar and lunar eclipses.  
   - Diagrams illustrating the alignment of the Sun, Earth, and Moon during each type of eclipse.  
   - A comparison table listing their differences concisely.  

### Key Learning Outcome  

By completing this assignment, the infographic should:  
- Provide a clear explanation of solar and lunar eclipses.  
- Use diagrams and visuals to simplify complex concepts.  
- Highlight the similarities and differences between the two phenomena.
